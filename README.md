# OldRBLXTemplates
Welcome to **OldRBLXTemplates, also known as Old Roblox Templates**, a dedicated repository for preserving and sharing older versions of uncopylocked Roblox templates. This repository serves as an archive for those who wish to explore or utilize earlier iterations of popular Roblox templates that have been freely available to the community.

### Purpose of the Repository
The primary goal of this repository is to provide access to historical versions of uncopylocked Roblox templates

### What Are Uncopylocked Templates?
In Roblox, an uncopylocked template is a game or model that the original creator has allowed others to copy and use. These templates are typically shared freely with the community, enabling other developers to modify and build upon them. The term "uncopylocked" means that the template's creator has not restricted it from being copied or reused.

### Why Reupload Older Versions?
While many uncopylocked templates are still available on Roblox, earlier versions may have been replaced or lost over time.


# Disclaimer
All templates in this repository are provided as-is and are intended for educational and archival purposes. We do not claim ownership of any of the templates and respect the rights of the original creators. If you believe a template has been uploaded in error or wish for it to be removed, please contact me.
